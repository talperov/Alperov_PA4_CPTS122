Assignment: This is programming assingment number 4 AKA (PA4). The goal of this assignment is to create a Fitness App in C++ that
allows the the user of this application to manualy edit, their diet or exercise plans. Majority of this assingment will be
heavily focused on three major classes. DietPlan, ExcercisePlan, FitnessAppWrapper.
Details: Prior to this assingment I have little knowledge of C++ but will do best to make a consistent program.
With the well known knowledge I have on C programming this assingment should be no issue.
